- at the top of the server.js file we are doing this:
  - var express = require('express')
  - I get it sort of...but what exactly is happening here?
  - Is 'express' a javascript module, and now are var express contains all of
    the code?
- What creates the posts table, the model/post.js file? At the end of ch. 4 we are able to post to the database through curl. Then we
  can type:
  - mongo social
  - db.posts.find()
